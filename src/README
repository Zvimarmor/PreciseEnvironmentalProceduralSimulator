9.2.4: Implementation explanation for the 'trees' module:
- 9.2.4.1: Classes used:
  - Forest: coordinates tree creation in a given range.
  - Tree: generates a single tree (trunk, leaves, fruits).
  - Leaf: animated swaying leaves.
  - Fruit: collectible, respawns over time.

- 9.2.4.2: Class relationships:
  - Forest calls Tree.create(...) for each position.
  - Tree adds Leaf and Fruit objects to GameObjectCollection.
  - Leaves and fruits are placed randomly around the trunk.

- 9.2.4.3: Design pattern:
  - We used a component-based approach and observer pattern.
  - CloudsManager implements JumpObserver and listens to Avatar.
  - When avatar jumps, CloudsManager gets notified and triggers rain.
    (Rain is triggered using a repeating ScheduledTask that creates falling droplets
    from the current cloud position.)
