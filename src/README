9.2.4: Implementation explanation for the 'trees' module:
- 9.2.4.1: Classes used:
  - Flora: coordinates tree creation in a given range.
  - Tree: generates a single tree (trunk, leaves, fruits).
  - Leaf: animated swaying leaves.
  - Fruit: collectible, respawns over time.

- 9.2.4.2: Class relationships:
  - Flora calls Tree.create for each position to create tree in it.
  - Tree adds Leaf and Fruit objects to GameObjectCollection.
  - Leaves and fruits are placed randomly around the trunk.

- 9.2.4.3: Design pattern:
We designed the tree-related classes using a modular and compositional approach.
Each Tree is built by combining smaller components - trunk blocks, Leaf objects,
and Fruit objects - each with its own logic and appearance.
(Separately, in the weather package, the CloudsManager class uses the Observer pattern:
Using the JumpObserver it gets notified by the Avatar when a jump occurs, causing the rain effect.)
